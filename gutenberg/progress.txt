5/8 - First I thought that tested the File reading by creating a text file and using Python to read and print its contents. Then I figured no matter how I implemented the rest, I'd need to strip punctuation so I began writing a function to do this, along with some tests which failed.

5/9 - Learned about strip, no longer need strip_punctuation
Investigated conversion of strings and ints to Booleans:
	     '' => False
	     other strings => True
	     0 => False
	     other numbers => True
