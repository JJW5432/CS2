			I used Sublime Text Editor to create this document. I like it because in addition to the standard syntax highlighting, it supports other useful features like the ability to edit place your cursor in multiple places at once. When coupled with Find, this means it is that much less typing to, for example, rename a variable at every point in a program. I also like its ability to install a variety of packages to add more functionality.
