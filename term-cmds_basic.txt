IntroCS2 Classwork for Monday 2014-02-10
========================================

Work with your neighbors to find out as much as you can about what each of these commands does. 
You already know how some of them work, so use your existing knowledge to make inferences as you experiment with the rest.
Record your findings in a plaintext file named term-cmds_basic.txt and upload to the HW server.

pwd 				=> print path of working directory
ls 					=> display working directory contents
ls -l 				=> display extra info like permissions and modified date
ls -al 				=> display extra info and display hidden files and folders
cd / 				=> change working directory to root
cd 					=> nothing
cd ~ 				=> change working directory to home directory
cd .. 				=> change working directory to the parent directory of the current working directory
cd ../.. 			=> change working directory to the parent directory of the parent directory (the grandparent directory if you will) of the current working directory
cd ~/Downloads 		=> change working directory to Downloads
exit 				=> logout of the tty session, usually starting login prompt


Execute these commands in the order listed, 
  from your home directory, 
    to best gain an understanding of their function.
------------------------------------------------------------
cd ~ 			=> change working directory to home directory
ls -l 			=> display extra info like permissions and modified date
touch foo 		=> create an empty file called "foo"
ls -l 			=> we now see the new file "foo"
ls -l fo* 		=> display extra info like permissions and modified date for all files matching the pattern fo*, which in this case is one f followed by any number (including 0) of o's
cp foo boo 		=> cp foo to a new file named boo
ls -l 			=> we see "boo" and "foo"
mv foo shoo 	=> rename "foo" "shoo"
ls -l 			=> we now see "foo" is called "shoo"


Now do the same for these -- again from your home directory:
------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir goo 		=> creates a directory called goo
ls -l 			=> we see this directory
rmdir goo 		=> deletes a directory called goo
ls -l 			=> we see that it's gone
mkdir goo 		=> creates a directory called goo again
cd goo 			=> change working directory to goo
ls -l 			=> look inside the empty directory
touch noo 		=> create an empty file called noo
ls -l 			=> see the file "noo"
cd .. 			=> exit from goo back into the parent directory
ls -l
rmdir goo 		=> delete the directory goo

(...what just happened? Can you figure out how to acheive your goal here?) => tty raised an error saying that "Directory not empty", maybe delete noo and then delete goo


Finally, issue this command:
man pwd
(and hit Q to exit when you're done reading)

...what does this tell you? => explains how to use pwd and all of its options

Does it work on other commands? => yes it does
Should you revisit some of the entries above after manning these commands? (Yes, you should...)
